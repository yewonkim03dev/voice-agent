# Voice Agent

## Terminal Harness

Run the local MVP harness with the in-memory backend:

```sh
npm run harness
```

The harness reads one line at a time from stdin, turns normal text into a `Transcript`, and sends it through `RuntimeController` with an in-memory `AgentBackend`. Voice responses are printed to the console instead of using real TTS.

Slash commands simulate Codex-side events in mock mode:

- `/status` prints the current runtime state and Codex status.
- `/permission <command>` creates a mock shell permission request.
- `/complete` sends a mock task-complete event.
- `/error <message>` sends a mock error event.
- `/tts-stop` stops the current TTS output.
- `/quit` stops the session.

To connect the terminal harness to a real local Codex app-server:

```sh
npm run harness:codex
```

Codex mode starts `codex app-server --listen ws://127.0.0.1:0`, opens a local websocket JSON-RPC connection, and sends normal text directly with `turn/start`. It does not run local intent classification or text-based permission parsing in front of Codex. This avoids fake approval prompts such as `approve_action`.

Real Codex mode also prepends a voice-agent response protocol prompt. The agent is asked to stream newline-delimited JSON events so short spoken responses can be sent to TTS before the full turn is complete:

```jsonl
{"op":"voice-agent","type":"speech","text":"확인했어. 테스트부터 돌려볼게."}
{"op":"voice-agent","type":"command","text":"npm test"}
{"op":"voice-agent","type":"speech","text":"테스트가 끝났어. 전부 통과했어."}
```

`speech` events are spoken immediately, `command` events are displayed but not spoken, and invalid or non-JSON output is kept as raw `[agent:stdout]` fallback. If a turn already emitted structured speech, the harness does not add the generic `끝났어.` completion TTS on top.

Always-on wake mode keeps listening while TTS is speaking, but raw VAD activity no longer stops TTS. Candidate speech is transcribed first; if it looks like recent TTS text, it is discarded as echo. During TTS, wake-only speech is ignored, `코덱스 멈춰` stops speech, and `코덱스 <new command>` stops speech before routing the new command.

Wake text is supported in the terminal as a development stand-in for a real wake detector:

```text
코덱스 간단한 npm test 돌려줘
```

The harness strips `코덱스` and forwards `간단한 npm test 돌려줘` to Codex. Plain text without a wake phrase is also forwarded for development convenience.

Native Codex approval requests are printed through the console voice output. While one is pending:

- `허용`, `yes`, `approve`, `allow`, `go ahead` send a one-time allow decision.
- `거부`, `아니`, `deny`, `reject`, `cancel` deny the request.
- `이번 세션 동안 허용` asks Codex for a session-scoped allow when Codex offers that decision.
- `같은 명령 계속 허용` asks Codex for a persistent command-policy amendment when Codex offers one.

If the speech is not clearly allow or deny, the harness asks `허용인지 거부인지 다시 말해줘.` and does not forward that utterance to Codex.

In Codex mode, `/permission <command>` is disabled because permissions must come from native Codex app-server approval requests.

Pass extra app-server flags after `--`:

```sh
npm run harness:codex -- -c 'model="gpt-5-codex"'
```

`npm run harness:real` is kept as an alias for `npm run harness:codex`.

Voice input mode is exposed as:

```sh
npm run setup:voice
npm run harness:voice:codex
```

This mode uses manual recording first so it can later swap `ManualRecordingGate` for a wake/VAD gate without changing STT or agent routing. Type `/record` to start recording and `/record` again to stop. The voice path is:

```text
AudioInput -> ListeningGate -> RecordingController -> UtteranceRecorder -> STT -> Transcript -> Agent pass-through
```

Always-on wake listening is exposed as:

```sh
npm run harness:wake:codex
```

This starts the same recorder/STT pipeline, but keeps the recorder process running and uses a lightweight VAD gate to cut candidate speech utterances. Each candidate utterance is transcribed once. If the transcript starts with a configured wake phrase, the wake phrase is stripped and the rest is forwarded to Codex. If it does not, the transcript is discarded.

```text
AudioInput -> VAD candidate detector -> STT -> WakePhraseRouter -> Agent pass-through
```

`/record` remains available as a manual fallback in always-on mode. Manual fallback routes the transcript directly through the existing harness, which is useful when debugging wake detection.

`npm run setup:voice` detects supported local recorder/STT commands and writes `.voice-agent.local.json`. On macOS with `/usr/bin/swift`, setup uses the built-in microphone through AVFoundation and Apple Speech for STT. The file is ignored by git and is read automatically by `npm run harness:voice:codex`.

Voice setup is provider-based: macOS Swift support is the first provider, and Windows/Linux providers can be added without changing `VoiceHarnessRunner`, STT routing, or agent pass-through.

Wake phrases are loaded from `.voice-agent.local.json` or `VOICE_AGENT_WAKE_PHRASES`. The default set is:

```json
["코덱스", "클로드", "codex", "claude", "hey codex", "hey claude"]
```

For example, to use `자비스`:

```json
{
  "recorderCommand": "exec swift src/audio/macos-record-pcm.swift",
  "sttCommand": "swift src/speech/macos-transcribe.swift {audio}",
  "sampleRate": 16000,
  "channels": 1,
  "wakePhrases": ["자비스", "코덱스", "codex"]
}
```

If auto-detection cannot find a supported command, configure manually with environment variables or by writing `.voice-agent.local.json`:

```sh
export VOICE_AGENT_RECORDER_COMMAND='rec -q -t raw -b 16 -e signed-integer -c 1 -r 16000 -'
export VOICE_AGENT_STT_COMMAND='your-local-whisper-command {audio}'
export VOICE_AGENT_WAKE_PHRASES='자비스,코덱스,codex'
```

`VOICE_AGENT_RECORDER_COMMAND` must stream 16kHz mono `pcm_s16le` audio to stdout. `VOICE_AGENT_STT_COMMAND` receives a WAV file path through `{audio}` and should print either plain transcript text or JSON like `{"text":"코덱스 npm test 돌려줘","language":"ko","confidence":0.99}`.

Real TTS output can be enabled with:

```sh
npm run harness:wake:codex -- --tts
```

On macOS, `--tts` defaults to the built-in Apple `AVSpeechSynthesizer` provider. Unsupported platforms keep the console voice output fallback unless a provider is explicitly added later. Console voice lines remain visible even when TTS is enabled.

TTS options can be passed as CLI flags:

```sh
npm run harness:wake:codex -- --tts --tts-voice Yuna --tts-gender female --tts-rate fast
```

To test only TTS without starting Codex:

```sh
npm run tts:test
npm run tts:test -- --ko "코덱스 음성 출력 테스트야."
npm run tts:test -- --en "Codex voice output test."
npm run tts:test -- --voice Yuna --ko "유나 목소리 테스트야."
npm run tts:test -- --list-voices
```

The native visual companion UI is Qt/QML-based and does not use a browser, Electron, Tauri, or WebView. To open the companion window by itself:

```sh
npm run visual
```

Visual provider setup prefers Qt/QML, falls back to the native macOS Swift/AppKit companion when Qt is not installed, and prints Qt install commands:

```sh
npm run setup:visual
```

To start the always-on harness with a local visual bridge and companion window:

```sh
npm run harness:wake:codex -- --visual
```

By default, `visual.provider` is `auto`: Qt/QML is used first when `qml6`, `qml`, `qmlscene6`, or `qmlscene` is on PATH; on macOS, missing Qt falls back to `swift visual/macos/VoiceAgentVisual.swift`. You can force a provider with `--visual-provider qtqml` or `--visual-provider macos-native`.

The UI receives state, volume, wake, speech, command, status, error, and approval events. NDJSON `command` events are shown in the command panel without being spoken. The bottom `TTS Stop` button sends the same control action as `/tts-stop`. If a requested visual provider is unavailable, the harness prints `[visual] unavailable: ...` and continues normally.

or configured through env:

```sh
export VOICE_AGENT_TTS_ENABLED=true
export VOICE_AGENT_TTS_PROVIDER=macos-apple
export VOICE_AGENT_TTS_VOICE=Yuna
export VOICE_AGENT_TTS_GENDER=female
export VOICE_AGENT_TTS_RATE=fast
```

or in `.voice-agent.local.json`:

```json
{
  "recorderCommand": "exec swift src/audio/macos-record-pcm.swift",
  "sttCommand": "swift src/speech/macos-transcribe.swift {audio}",
  "sampleRate": 16000,
  "channels": 1,
  "wakePhrases": ["자비스", "코덱스", "codex"],
  "tts": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "macos-apple",
    "language": "auto",
    "gender": "auto",
    "rate": "fast"
  }
}
```

The macOS helper is `src/voice/macos-speak.swift`. It uses `AVSpeechSynthesizer`, selects Korean or English voices from the message language, and can list installed system voices through `npm run tts:test -- --list-voices`.

If either capability is missing, setup prints `[voice:setup]` guidance and the harness prints an exact `[voice:capability]` message before starting Codex.

Claude mode is exposed as:

```sh
npm run harness:claude
```

It probes the local `claude` CLI. If the CLI is broken or no supported structured approval transport is available, it prints the exact missing capability instead of pretending to drive Claude through an unsafe PTY shim.

This branch intentionally does not implement visual UI, production wake-word ML, cloud TTS providers, or a third-party PTY dependency. Always-on wake mode uses VAD plus one STT pass per candidate utterance, then discards transcripts that do not start with a configured wake phrase.
